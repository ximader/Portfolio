**Test case in area of image segmentation.**

#### TASK:
Create and train image segmentation model combined of Unet and Binary classification models.
Both models should be trained simultaneously.
Classification model should use predictions from Unet model.
3 metrics should be used : accuracy, recall, precision.

#### INPUT:
Dataset of 200 images with or without persons and 200 corresponding segmentation masks
80% (160 images) should be used for training and 20% (40 images) for validation.
